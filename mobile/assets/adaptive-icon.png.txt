This should be replaced with an actual PNG image.

For development purposes, you can:
1. Create a 108x108px PNG image with your app icon
2. Name it "adaptive-icon.png"
3. Place it in the assets folder

Or use an online placeholder service to generate one.

Example Android Adaptive Icon Requirements:
- Size: 108x108 pixels (1080x1080px for high res)
- Format: PNG
- Should have transparency
- Center icon area should be 72x72 (on a 108x108 canvas)
